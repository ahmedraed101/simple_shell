###some information about Unix shell
- In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer, which was chosen
mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby
work on it.

- The first Unix shell was the Thompson shell, sh, written by Ken Thompson
at Bell Labs and distributed with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971
to 1975

- Ken Thompson also invented the B programming language, direct predecessor
to the C programming language.

- Ken Thompson (born in 1943), North American computer scientist, designed
and implemented the original UNIX operating system, while working at
Bell Labs. He also invented the B programming language, direct predecessor
to the C programming language; among other contributions.

- The shell manages the interaction between you and the operating system
by prompting you for input, interpreting that input for the operating
system, and then handling any resulting output from the operating system.
Shells provide a way for you to communicate with the operating system.

- In short, a PID (Process ID) is a unique identifier assigned by the
operating system to each running process, while a PPID (Parent Process ID)
is the PID of the parent process that created the current process

- The main difference between system call and function call is that a system
call is a request for the kernel to access a resource while a function call
is a request made by a program to perform a specific task.
